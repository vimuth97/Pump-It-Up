# Pump-It-Up

This is a solution for the classification challenge `Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table` by `DrivenData` available at <br /> https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/ using sklearn on jupyter notebook.

Followings are the pre-processing and feature engineering techniques I used to in my solution.

## Pre-processing techniques
1. Converted all categorical values in the dataframe to lowercase.
2. Handling missing values. <br />
   Missing values of following features were filled with corresponding values.<br />
| Feature name    | Value       |
| -----------     | ----------- |
| scheme_name     | -1          |
| scheme_management     | -1      |
| funder      | -1      |
| public_meeting     | -1      |
| permit     | -1      |
| subvillage     | -1      |
